# open-devin-gpu-accelerated
This project provides an accelerated, microservice infrastructure for running Devin and other AI agents on NVIDIA GPUs for a 100x speedup. It provides an open-sourced LLM agent and underlying GPU infrastructure to provide transformative workflows leveraging best-in-class and plugable ML and AI models. 

AI agents are the future of software engineering, with unlimited potential to solve problems that conventional methods would take years to solve. By pairing AI agents ü§ñ with conventional biological / in-vivo agents üßç more code can be built faster, with less error!

This application brings a single-pane of glass for managing your in-silico agents in a scalable, distributed manner. The framework allows for easy extension and modification, following software architecture best practices.
